= Project: IOT Coursework

= Features
- Real-time crowd estimation using sensor data and a regression model.
- Dynamic dashboard visualization for operators and students.
- Actuator logic to control LEDs based on demand thresholds.
- Integration with Arduino IoT Cloud for live data synchronization and predictions.

== Step 1: Installation
1. Clone or download this repository from GitHub: https://github.com/wenhaohong/iot-coursework.
2. Install the required libraries in the Arduino IDE, including:
   - WiFiClientSecure
   - LoRa
   - ArduinoIoTCloud
   - Sensor libraries as mentioned in `libraries.txt` file.
3. Open the Arduino IDE and configure your ESP32 board:
   - Go to **Tools > Board > ESP32 Dev Module**.
   - Set your COM port and upload speed.

== Step 2: Assemble the circuit
Assemble the circuit following the provided diagram in `layout.png`:
- Connect sensors (temperature, humidity, and microphone) to the ESP32 microcontroller as per the pin configuration.
- Attach the LED to indicate demand thresholds.
- Ensure proper power supply and communication via LoRa.

== Step 3: Load the code
1. Open the Arduino sketch file `iot_dec06a.ino`.
2. Configure WiFi and IoT Cloud credentials in the setup section of the code.
3. Upload the sketch to the ESP32 board using the **Upload** button in the Arduino IDE.
